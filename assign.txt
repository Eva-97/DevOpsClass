"Hello"
I am your favourite programmer
and I started a DevOps Class

Also,
I have been trying to decode the elements of my new AWS portal.
Such a great place to be.

Oh! Let me be sincere with you.
I am not tired, just hungry and confused with this whole training.
@richmind pls come to my rescue :(
